Phase 1: Use Cases
-

Given the popularity of the series The Great British Baking Show, the local Pittsburgh PBS station WQED has scrapped the studio of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood and has converted it to the set for the next huge television hit series: The Great Pittsburgh Baking Show.  Seeing local Pittsburgh people preparing culinary delights will revive the station and bring in much needed viewers.  Moreover, to monetize this series further, the station wants to create an online store called the Great Pittsburgh Bakery Outlet, where amateur chefs purchase a variety of baking equipment and supplies that are used on the show.  Since this is a PBS station, their budget is extremely limited, so they have recruited you to create this e-commerce system due to your remarkable skills and low rates (i.e., pro bono). They provided you with the application specifications. 

To help you in this endeavor, you are provided with several items that you will find links to at the bottom of this page. The first is a narrative describing important facts about the Baking Outlet what is needed from this online application. The remaining files are templates for documents that you will need in this phase and some additional details.

In this phase, we will focus on creating and documenting the set of uses cases that the system must implement to be considered fully working. Students will use the use case template provided below to structure their documents. All the actors should be indicated along with their complexity levels. 

This phase will constitute **3 percent** of your final course grade.

Student solutions to this phase are to be uploaded to canvas in a zip file named as follows: `andrewID_phase1.zip` by **11:59PM on January 26th, 2022**. **Absolutely no late submissions will be accepted**.

If you have questions regarding the turn-in of this project or problems downloading any of the materials below, please post them on Piazza or ask someone well in advance of the turn-in date. Waiting until the day before it is due to get help is unwise -- you risk not getting a timely response that close to the deadline and will not be given an extension because of such an error.
